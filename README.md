# Why does harmonic distortion happen?

Because real amplifiers are not perfectly linear.
When you increase the input power, the active device (BJT, MOSFET, HEMT) enters:

Nonlinear gm region

Soft compression

Hard clipping

Saturation

As a result, the output waveform gets "bent", creating harmonic components.

# Why harmonic distortion is important in RF & Microwave?
Because harmonics can:
Interfere with adjacent channels,
Cause spectral regrowth,
Reduce EVM / degrade modulation accuracy,
Harm compliance with FCC/ETSI standards,
Cause receiver blocking,
Reduce power amplifier efficiency due to unwanted outputs,
For LNAs:
→ Low harmonic distortion = better linearity, IMD, IIP3, SFDR
